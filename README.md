# IDS-with-CNN
Intrusion Detection system using Convolutional Neural Network
<br><br>

This is an Anomaly based Intrusion Detection system which classifies the network traffic. The top features 31 that have a greater importance in the classification process are selected using SelectKBest feature selection method. The feature vectors from the dataset are transformed into the feature matrices to form the images as the inputs of the CNN. <br><br>
